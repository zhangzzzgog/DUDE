        'When evaluating clicks, prioritize actions that directly advance the user\'s stated goal. For tasks involving completing a purchase, accessing content, or subscribing, verify that the click targets a primary action button (e.g., "Confirm," "Continue," "Subscribe," "Book Now") rather than secondary or promotional elements. Check if the click resolves a blocking modal or pop-up that is essential to proceed with the task. Avoid clicks on unrelated ads, navigation elements, or non-essential UI components that do not contribute to task completion. Ensure the click aligns with the specific requirements of the task, such as selecting a plan, confirming details, or bypassing optional upgrades. Additionally, when a task requires navigating to a specific item or category, ensure the click targets the correct element (e.g., a product listing, category filter, or search result) rather than unrelated content. This ensures the action directly contributes to the task\'s objective.'
